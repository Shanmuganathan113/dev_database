Anger is a natural, adaptive response to threats: it inspires powerful, often aggressive, feelings and behaviours, which allow us to fight and to defend ourselves when we are attacked. On the other hand, we can\'t physically lash out at every person or object that irritates or annoys us: laws, social norms and common sense place on how far our anger can take us. People use a variety of both conscious and unconscious processes to deal with their angry feelings. The three main approaches are expressing, suppressing and calming. Expressing your angry feelings in an assertive anger. Being assertive dosen\'t mean being pushy or demanding: it means being respectful of yourself and others. Anger can be suppressed and then converted or redirected. This happens when you in your anger, stop thinking about it and focus on something positive.</p>'),(4,'<p>The crowd surged forward through the narrow streets of Paris. There was a clatter of shutters being closed hastily by trembling hands Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the citizen of Paris knew that once the fury of the people was excited there was no telling what they might do. They came to an old house which had a workshop on the ground floor. A head popped out of the door to see what it was all about \"Get him Get Thimonier! Smash his devilish machines\" yelled the crowd.	They found the workshop without its owner. M.Thimonier had escaped by the back door. Now the furty of the demonstrators turned against the machines that were standing in the shop, ready to be delivered to buyers. They were systematically broken up and destroyed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ dozens of them. Only when the last wheel and spindle had been tramples under foot did the infuriated crowd recover their senses.<br/>	\"That is the end of M\'Sieur Thimonier and his sewing machines\", they said to one another and went home satisfied. Perhaps now they would find work, for they were all unemployed tailors and seamstresses who believed that their livelihood was threatened by that new invention.</p>'),(5,'<p>An upsurge of new research suggests that animals have a much higher level of brain-power than previously thought. If animal do have intelligence, how do scientists measure it? Before defining animals intelligence, scientists defined what is not intelligence instinct is not intelligence. It is a skill programmed in to an animals brain by its genetic heritage. Rote conditionings is also not intelligence. Tricks can be learned by repetition, but no real thinking is involved. Cuing, in which animals learn to do or not to do certain things by following outside signals. Does not demonstrate intelligence. Scientists believe that insight, the ability to use tools, and communication using human language are all effective measures of the mental ability of animals.<br/>When judging animals intelligence, scientists look for insight which they define as a flash of sudden understanding. When a young gorilla could not reach fruit from a tree, she noticed crates scattered about the lawn near the tree. She noticed crates into a pyramid, then climbed on them to reach her reward. The gorillas insight allowed her to solve a new problem without trial and error.</p>'),(6,'<p>In ancient times, a king had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the kingdoms wealthiest merchants and countries came by and simply walked around it. Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way. Then a peasant came along, carrying a load of vegetables. On approaching the boulder. The peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded.<br/>As the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway.<br/>	The peasant learned what many others never understand: Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve one\'s condition.</p>'),(7,'<p>Whatever the problem, someone can always oversimplify it. Sometimes a problem is simpler than it seems at first sight, and a cool mind can point to an easy answer. More often though, the simple answers don\'t really meet the case. A great scientist of an earlier day, Sir Arthur Eddington, once said that we often think all about two, because \"two is one and one\" We forget that we still have to make a study of \"and\". <br/>There\'s an important point here, an extra factor in the equation. Whether we are dealing with fellow humans, or even with observed \"scientific fact\", one and one often make more than two, because there\'s a relationship as well as a number. There\'s a mysterious chemistry that alters things, just through their being together. One think which makes paintings fascinating and demanding is allowing for this. Put a spot of bright yellow paint on a background of grey, and the yellow spot on a bright blue background, and the tallow looks duller and smaller. The same color is changed by what\'s around it\'s changed by relationship.</p>'),(8,'<p>The clergyman was finishing the graveside service. Suddenly, the 78-year-old man whose wife of 50 years had just died began screaming in a thick accent, \"Oh oh, oh, how I loved her!\" His mournful wail interrupted the dignified quiet of the ceremony. The other family and friends standing around the grave looked shocked and embarrassed. His grown children, blushing, tried to shush ther father. \"It\'s okey, Dad: we understand. Shush.\" The old man stared fixedly at the casket lowering slowly into the grave. The clergyman went on. Finished, he invited the family to shovel some dirt into the coffin as a mark of the finality of death. Each , in turn, did so with the exception of the old man. \"Oh how I loved her !\" he moaned loudly. His daughter and two sons again tried to restrain him, but he continued, \"I loved her !\" Now, as the rest of those gathered around began leaving the grave, the old man stubbornly resisted. He stayed. Staring into the grave. The clergyman approached. \"I know how you must feel, but it\'s time to leave. We all must leave and go on with life.\"\"Oh, how I loved her !\" the old man moaned, miserably. \"You don\'t understand,\" he said to the clergyman. I\" almost told her once.\"</p>'),(9,'The cyber-world is ultimately ungovernable. This is alarming well as convenient; sometimes, convenient because alarming. Some Indian politicians use this to great advantage. When there is an obvious failure in governance during a crisis they deflect attention from their own incompetence towards the ungovernable. So, having failed to prevent nervous citizens from fleeing their cities of work by assuring them of proper protection, some national leaders are now busy trying to prove to one another, and to panic-prone Indians, that a  mischievous neighbor has been using the internet and social networking sites to spread dangerous rumors. And the Centre\'s automatic reaction is to start blocking these sites and begin elaborate and potentially endless negotiations with Google, Twitter and Facebook about access to information. If this is the official idea of prompt action at a time of crisis among communities, then Indians have more reason to fear their protectors than the nebulous mischief-makers of the cyber-world. Wasting time gathering proof, blocking vaguely suspicious-websites, hurling accusations across the border and worrying about bilateral relations are ways of keeping busy with inessentials because one does not quite know what to do about the essentials of a difficult situation. Besides, only a fifth of the 245 websites blocked by the Centre mention the people of the Northeast or the violence in Assam. And if a few morphed images and spurious texts can unsettle an entire nation, then there is something deeply wrong with the nation and with how it is being governed. This is what its leaders should be addressing immediately, rather than making a wrong heading display of their powers of censorship.<br/>	It is just as absurd, and part of the same syndrome, to try to ban Twitter accounts that parody dispatches from the Prime Minister\'s Office. To describe such forms of humor and dissent as \"misrepresenting\" the PMO-as if Twitters would take these parodies for genuine dispatches from the PMO-makes the PMO look more ridiculous than its parodists manage to. With the precedent for such action set recently by the chief minister of West Bengal, this is yet another proof that what Bengal thinks today India will think tomorrow. Using the cyber-world for flexing the wrong muscles is essentially not funny. It might even prove to be quite dangerously distracting.'),(10,'<p>\"Nobody knows my name\" is the title of one James Baldwin\'s celebrated books. Who knows the mane of the old man sitting amidst ruins pondering over his hubble-bubble? We do not. It does not matter. He is there like the North Pole, the Everest and the Alps but with one difference. The North Pole, the Everest and the Alps will be there when he is not there any more. Can we really say this? \"Dust thou act to dust returneth\" was not spoken of the soul. We do not know whether the old man\'s soul will go marching on like john Brown\'s. while his body lies moldering in the grave or becomes ash driven by the wind or is immersed in water, such speculation is hazardous. A soul\'s trip can take one to the treacherous shoals of metaphysics where there is no \"yes\" or \"no\". who am I? asked Tagore of the rising sun in the first dawn of his life, he received no answer. \"Who am I?\" he asked the setting sun in the last twilight of his. He received no answer.<br/>	We are no more on solid ground with dust which we can feel in our hands, scatter to the wind and wet with water to turn it into mud. For this much is sure, that in the end, when life\'s ceaseless labor grinds to a halt and man meets death, the brother of sleep, his body buried or burnt, becomes dust. In the form of dust he lives, inanimate yet in contact with the animate. He settles on files in endless government almirahs, on manuscripts written and not published on all shelves, on faces and hands. He becomes ubiquitous all pervasive, sometimes sneaking even into hermetically sealed chambers.<br/></p>'),(11,'<p>To write well you have to be able to write clearly and logically, and you cannot do this unless you can think clearly and logically. If you cannot do this yet you should train yourself to do it by taking particular problems and without leaving anything out and without avoiding any difficulties that you meet.<br/>	At first you find clear, step-by-step thought very difficult. You may find that your mind is not able to concentrate. Several unconnected ideas may occur together. But practice will improve your ability to concentrate on a single idea and think about it clearly and logically. In order to increase your vocabulary and to improve your style, you should read widely and use a good dictionary to help you find the exact meanings and correct usages of words.<br/>	Always remember that regular and frequent practice is necessary if you want to learn to write well. It is no good waiting until you have an inspiration before you write. Even with the most famous writers, inspiration is rare. Someone said that writing is ninety-nine per cent hard work and one per cent inspiration, so the sooner you get into the habit of disciplining yourself to write, the better.<br/></p>'),(12,'<p>Once upon an unfortunate time, there was a hairy thing called \'man\' . along with him was a hairier thing called \'animal\'. Man had a larger brain which made him think he was superior to animals. Some men thought they were superior to others. They became leader men. Leader men said \'We have no need to work: we will kill animals to eat.\' So they did. Man increased and animals decreased. Eventually leader men said, \'There are not enough animals left to eat. We must grow our own food.\' So man grew food. Everywhere man killed all wild life. Soon there was none and all the birds were poisoned. Leader men said, \'At last we are free of pests.\'<br/>	Man\'s numbers increased. The world became crowded with men. They all had to sleep standing up. One day a leader man saw some new creatures eating his crops. The creature\'s name was \'the starving people\'. These creature are a menace!\' said the leader man. <br/></p>'),(13,'<p>The great advantage of early rising is the good start it gives for one\'s daily work. The early riser is able to complete a lot of work before others even get out of their bed . As the mind is fresh in the morning, free from distractions, one is able to do quality work. One is able, if so inclined, to have early morning exercises which keep one energetic throughout the day. Thus one completes one\'s work during the day without hurrying much and is left with time in the evening for play or entertainment or relaxation by a leisurely walk. This leads to a good night\'s rest after which one is able to rise fresh the next morning to face another day.</p>'),(14,'<p>Every profession or trade, every art and every since has its technical vocabulary, the function of which is party to designate things or processes which have no names in ordinary English and party to secure greater exactness in nomenclature. Such special dialects or jargons are necessary in technical discussion of any kind. Being universally understood by the devotees of the particular since or art, they have the precision of a mathematical formula. Besides, they save time, for it is much more economical to name a process than to describe it. Thousands of these technical terms are very property included in every large dictionary, yet, as a whole, they are rather on the outskirts of the English language than actually within its borders.<br/>	Different occupations, however, differ widely in the character of their special vocabularies. In trades and handicrafts and other vocations like farming and fishing that have occupied great numbers of men from remote times, the technical vocabulary is very old. An average man now uses these in his own vocabulary. The special dialects of law, medicine, divinity and philosophy have become familiar to cultivated persons.</p>'),(15,'<p>Gregor Mendal appropriately called \"Father of Genetics\", joined as supply teacher at Brunn to study Natural sciences and Mathematics. During his tenure in teaching, he started his historic experiments with Garden Peas (Pisum Sativum) in the monastery garden. It was an annual plant with well defined characteristics. Flowers were bisexual and self fertilized, through many generation of natural self fertilization garden peas had developed into pure lines. He selected seven pairs of contrasting characters among pea plants and all were related as dominant and recessive fortunately.</p>'),(16,'<p>Steel and Aluminium have higher bulk and shear modulus than lead.
